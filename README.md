# Java example classes from CCPS 109 and CCPS 209

A collection of Java example classes from the courses CCPS 109 *Computer Science I* (old Java version not taught any more) and CCPS 209 *Computer Science II*, as taught by [Ilkka Kokkarinen](http://scs.ryerson.ca/~ikokkari) for the Chang School of Continuing Education, Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario.

The YouTube playlist [CCPS 209 Computer Science II, Java](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm1Sd7Iw1hHsRtM6KX5-XKGmOOvcDPBiB) collects the author's video lectures of this material.

All source code is released under GNU General Public License v3. All computer science instructors are free to use and adapt these examples in their courses as they see fit. The author welcomes feedback from all such learners and instructors at `ilkka.kokkarinen@gmail.com`.

Most of these classes do not include a `main` method. The author recommends [BlueJ](http://www.bluej.org) for introductory Java instruction due to its interactive nature.
